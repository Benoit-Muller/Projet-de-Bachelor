	abstract = {The famous Lotka-Volterra equations play a fundamental role in the mathematical modeling of various ecological and chemical systems. A new modification of these equations has been recently suggested to model the structure of marine phage populations, which are the most abundant biological entities in the biosphere. The purpose of the paper is: (i) to make some methodical remarks concerning this modification; (ii) to discuss new types of canards which arise naturally in this context; (iii) to present results of some numerical experiments.}

    abstract = {Mathematical ecology is a subject which recently attracts attentions of many mathematicians and biologists. One of the most important and fundamental mathematical models in ecology is of Lotka-Volterra type. This book gives global dynamical properties of L-V systems. The properties analyzed are global stability of the equilibria, persistence or permanence of the systems (which ensures the survival of all the biological-species composed of the systems for the long term) and the existence of periodic or chaotic solutions. The special subject of this book is to consider the effects of the systems},
